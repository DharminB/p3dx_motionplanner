# p3dx_motionplanner

This is a fork from https://github.com/meco-group/omg-tools 

The src folder contains the original scripts along with simplified version
of the motionplanner

dyn_single_motionplanner provides real time feedback when running holonomic vehicle but becomes
extremely slow when running diff drive robot.
